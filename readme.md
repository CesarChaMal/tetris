#Tetris

This is an old project of mine back from school in '96, a game written in Turbo Pascal 7.0

The executable can be started from within DosBOX, if you can help me to build a version that can run from windows then please let me know.

All the text are in Hungarian yet, just press F1 to start a new game, and press F10 to quit.
